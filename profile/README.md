The A&E endpoint requires more edits; the first parts will be visible by 7 April.  In general, all the Project/Model Details pages require much more edits, they will be accessible as soon as they are in legible states.  Meanwhile

* Visit the river level predictions page; other components, e.g., drift graphs, overarching error metrics, etc., will be suddenly visible.
* Interact with the token classification application.
